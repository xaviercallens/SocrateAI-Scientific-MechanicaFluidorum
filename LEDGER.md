### `lean_src/DyadicShells.lean` — dyadic laboratory (Stage 1)

| Claim | Formal name | Since |
|---|---|---|
| Nonlinear energy flux telescopes to −outFlux N (arbitrary `k`, `a`) | `dyadic_flux_telescopes` | 2026-08-12 (D2) |
| Net nonlinear flux vanishes under truncation `a_{N+1}=0` | `dyadic_flux_zero_of_boundary` | 2026-08-12 (D2) |
| **Energy monotonicity** `dE/dt ≤ 0` for `ν ≥ 0` under truncation | `energyRate_nonpos` | 2026-08-12 (D3) |

*Scope (honesty clause): these are statements about a **finite sum**, not yet about ODE
solutions — no existence theory is invoked. They establish the ENERGY identity, **not** an
enstrophy bound; the enstrophy question (the Hypothesis U analogue) remains untouched.
Non-vacuity: witness pins `energyRate = −1` exactly, so `≤ 0` is not `0 ≤ 0`.*

*22 theorems total across the three files; all footprints verified
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` by independent recompilation 2026-08-12.*

*Scope note (honesty clause): these are lemmas about `max(R, α/R)`, scalar recurrences, and
abstract classes — not yet about fluids.*

## Tier B — exact-arithmetic verified (ℚ, zero floats)

| Claim | Check | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Sym² lock, constant coeff. (196-case sweep) | B1 | `tests/tier_b_exact_checks.py` |
| Sym² lock, variable coefficients | B2 | ibid. (kernel proof exists in prior tree; migration = Stage 0) |
| Reff laws over ℚ, sqrt-free square forms | B3 | ibid. |
| L3 coefficients recoverable from data (guess-and-prove closes) | B4 | ibid. |
| Sharpness at self-dual radius; piecewise ≡ max for R>0; disagreement at R=−1 | B5 | ibid. |
| Spectral form of the Sym² lock over root pairs | B6 | ibid. |

| Unconstrained triads N(M) = #{ (k₁,k₂,k₃) ∈ (ℤ³)³ : k₁ + k₂ = k₃, \|kᵢ\|² ≤ M² }, M ∈ {2,4,8,16}, negative control (< vs ≤) | T0.2 | `data/triads_free.csv` |
| Lattice counts r₃(n), n ≤ 10000; Legendre anchors incl. r₃(7)=r₃(15)=0; negative control fails | T0.1 | `data/r3_counts.csv` (sha256 `4d51aa5a…33f1`) |
| **Dyadic energy flux telescopes** (exact ℚ, N=1..12, 240 cases) + partial-sum form (1800 cases); negative control (k_{n-1}→k_n) fails with residual 2/3 | D1 | `tests/tier_b_dyadic_checks.py` |
| Exact 3-D periodic percolation instrument: union-find, wrap detection, 27 checks; negative control (drop x-periodicity) fails | T0.3 | `symbolic/percolation_exact.py`, `tests/test_percolation.py` |

## Tier A — `lean_src/HypothesisU_Statements.lean` (statement shape; audited 2026-08-12)

Q1 and Q2 (below) were **decided by the human owner 2026-08-12** and implemented same day;
recompiled independently, 9 theorems, all footprints clean. The *shape* of the statement is
now audited; the *instantiation* of `B` by the true NSE nonlinearity remains explicitly
out of scope (declared exclusion in the file) and is where the program's real content lives.

| Claim | Formal name | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `truncate` projects `u₀` onto modes ≤ N; `truncate 0-datum = 0-datum` | `truncate`, `truncate_zero` | Q1: projected initial data, mirroring `u(0)=J_{√α'}u₀` |
| `IsGalerkinSolution` clause (i) is `u 0 = truncate N u0` — no vacuity leak across cutoffs | `IsGalerkinSolution` | Q1 |
| Concrete weight `w n = (2ⁿ)²`, matching `DyadicShells.lean`'s `k_n` | `dyadicWavenumber`, `dyadicWeight` | Q2: concrete `w n = k n²` |
| Enstrophy is genuinely nonnegative (general `w ≥ 0`, and the concrete dyadic instance) | `enstrophy_nonneg`, `enstrophy_nonneg_dyadic` | Q2 |
| Concrete top-level statement | `HypothesisU_dyadic` | Q1+Q2 combined |
| **The prior formalization is provably false** (machine-checked, not prose) | `unconstrained_bound_false` (via `enstrophy_smul`) | — |
| `IsGalerkinSolution` is inhabited (non-vacuity, §7.5) | `zero_isGalerkinSolution` | — |

*Remaining open item, unaffected by Q1/Q2:* `B` (the mode-interaction term) is still an
abstract parameter; no claim about actual Navier–Stokes solutions may be drawn from this file.

## Tier C — conjectures, analogies, unformalized arguments

| Claim | Status | Roadmap |
|---|---|---|
| **Hypothesis U** (core assertion) | Open, Millennium-equivalent | Resolved by Stage 3 success (Weeks 17–28) |
| **Conjecture U** (mechanism via Sym² lock) | Unproven, architecturally sound | Verified via four analytical tracks |
| **Proposition 5.1** (U ⇒ regularity) | Paper-level standard; formalization = Stage 2 | Weeks 9–16 (Leray mollification, Prodi-Serrin) |
| **Stage 1: Shell-Model Well-Posedness** | Target: Tier A/B | Weeks 3–8. Falsifiable milestone: no blow-up in 100 empirical runs. |
| **Track T1 (Bourgain-Demeter)** | Arithmetic depletion via ℓ² decoupling | Weeks 17–24. Milestone: triadic resonance count η(M) ≪ 1. |
| **Track T2 (Villani-Mouhot)** | Phase mixing & enstrophy echo suppression | Weeks 17–24. Milestone: echo amplitude decays exponentially. |
| **Track T3 (Golse-Saint-Raymond)** | Hydrodynamic entropy limits as α' → 0 | Weeks 17–24. Milestone: dissipation rate O(1) uniform in α'. |
| **Track T4 (Duminil-Copin)** | Percolation scaling & zero Hausdorff dimension | Weeks 17–24. Milestone: subcritical percolation, dim < 1. |
| OP-1: Derive J_{√α'} dynamics from Reff metric | Open problem; metric = inspiration only | Research frontier (deferred). |
| Sym² lock relevance to NSE cascade | To be earned in Stage 1 dyadic lab | Validated empirically + formally (Stage 1). |
| All physical narrative (cosmology, dark sector) | Quarantined in `docs/narrative/` | Never imported by `lean_src/`. |
| **OP-2…OP-5 draft definitions** (Sym²-spectrum embedding, enstrophy echo, entropy functional, percolation coupling) | Drafted 2026-08-12, **awaiting human audit** (PLAN.md §6 — audit is what unblocks, not authorship) | `docs/designs/TRACK_DEFINITIONS_DRAFT.md`. Surfaces a structural finding: the proposed T3 (`h=Ω, ū=0`) collapses into the direct production-identity attack rather than being independent; T1 and T4 share the OP-2 embedding and so are correlated, not independent, measurements. |

## Retired / corrected claims

| v0.1 claim | Disposition |
|---|---|
| "Reff theorems proven in Lean with zero custom axioms" | Was false when written (no such proofs existed); made true 2026-08-12. |
| `genesis_no_singularity` with axiom `alpha_prime` | Violated §7.1 and its own #print-axioms expectation; superseded by axiom-free `Reff_pos`. |
| Prior-tree `HypothesisU` (arbitrary smooth fields) | Provably false as formalized (scaling); statement to be rebuilt with the equation as constraint (Stage 2). |
| Prior-tree `global_well_posedness_regularized_shell` | Trivial witness (u ≡ 0); statement to be rebuilt quantifying over data (Stage 1). |
| `axiom aubin_lions_compactness` | Banned form; to re-enter as hypothesis parameter (Stage 2). |
| Proposal (2026-08-12) `Reff_ge_sqrt` "proven, no sorry" | Did **not** compile (4 Lean-idiom errors); footprint contained `sorryAx`. Statement is true and was already proven in the core by another route. Evidence: `docs/proposals/2026-08-12-proposal-kernel-log.txt`. |
| Proposal `genesis_no_singularity` with `opaque alpha_prime` + `axiom alpha_prime_pos` | Compiled, but footprint carried `alpha_prime_pos`; `opaque` improves on v0.1 yet still fails the gate. Superseded by the axiom-free parameterized version. |
